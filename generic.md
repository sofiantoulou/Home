We look for the insights in every project we dive into. This is our story.

For 10 years, as an independent co-designer and as a founding partner of the DesignThinkers Greece, Sofia creates workshops & trainings for teams, businesses and organizations in Greece which embody the philosophy of Service Design Thinking.

As this philosophy is central to the way we work it has become central to our design identity.

We collect and create canvases, guides and learnings to inspire teams of professional & non-professional designers and to enable their co-design in workshops. To facilitate great workshops, we localize global trends & creative know-how to work with cultural differences and multi-disciplinary teams. Our goal is to help team members who work at the intersection of design, technology and business, progress in their careers and find more satisfaction in their work.
